# COMM510:  Hybridisation of SMS-EMOA with Regression Models for bi-objective test sets ZDT1, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6 

The use of hypervolume as an indicator for the survival of individuals in a population in SMS-EMOA can be considered computationally expensive. This study as such explores the use of a variety of regression models to replace approximately half of the calculations for the hypervolume contribution made by the EA for the *ZDT1*,*ZDT3*, *ZDT4* and *ZDT6* test sets.
