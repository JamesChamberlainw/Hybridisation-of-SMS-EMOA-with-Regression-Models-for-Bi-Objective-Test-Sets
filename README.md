# Hybridisation-of-indicator-based-MOEA-and-Machine-Learning
 Explore how regression or classification techniques can be used to build a model of indicators in indicator-based MOEAs. Select an indicator-based MOEA of your choice and use one of the following indicators when building a machine learning model: Hypervolume, IGD, R2. Test the algorithm on either benchmark set 3 or real-world problems.
