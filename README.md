# COMM510:  Hybridisation of indicator-based MOEA and Machine Learning Corusework 
The aim of this coursework is to explore how regression or classification techniques can be used to build a model of indicators in indicator-based MOEAs. Select an indicator-based MOEA of your choice and use one of the following indicators when building a machine learning model: Hypervolume, IGD, R2. Test the algorithm on either benchmark set 3 or real-world problems.

This will be completed working on the following benchmark problems: ZDT1, ZDT3, ZDT4, ZDT6 with number of variables, D = [5, 10, 30] and number of objectives, M = 2. You should test the algorithm on all possible values of D. 

# Coursework Aim 

Must create a model based on either Hypervolume, IGD or R2 indicators, where this will then be used in a indicator based MOEA - here it should then improve upon these base MOEA reducing computation time. 

I will need a better termination indicator to say when its complete - i.e., some level of acceptable error from the front. 

A model for the indicator itself?
