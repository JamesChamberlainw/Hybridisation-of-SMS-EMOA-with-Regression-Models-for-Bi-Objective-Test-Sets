# COMM510:  Hybridisation of indicator-based MOEA and Machine Learning Corusework 
The aim of this coursework is to explore how regression or classification techniques can be used to build a model of indicators in indicator-based MOEAs. Select an indicator-based MOEA of your choice and use one of the following indicators when building a machine learning model: Hypervolume, IGD, R2. Test the algorithm on either benchmark set 3 or real-world problems.

This will be completed working on the following benchmark problems: ZDT1, ZDT3, ZDT4, ZDT6 with number of variables, D = [5, 10, 30] and number of objectives,
M = 2. You should test the algorithm on all possible values of D.
